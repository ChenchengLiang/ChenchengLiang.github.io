This thesis replaces or augments them with learned guidance: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on graph representations of Constrained Horn Clauses and word equations. Integrated into a CHC solver and a word‑equation solver, the models guide clause and branch selection and deliver consistent speedups, with practical techniques (caching, hybrid heuristics, selective queries) to control overhead. The results point to scalable, data‑driven heuristics for formal methods and motivate extensions to models, datasets, and the word‑equation pipeline.   - Online record in [DiVA](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1944055&dswid=-2900), [Slides](/assets/slides/defense.pdf)    "

    "content": "CozySteps — Our LLM-powered activity recommender for families with autistic children 🧩     Built during Impact Hack 2025 by AI Sweden     🧠 Background &amp; Motivation  We joined Impact Hack 2025, a hackathon organized by AI Sweden that encourages teams to use AI-driven innovation to tackle real societal challenges.  Our chosen challenge: help families with autistic children discover suitable activities for their kids.  Many autistic children are highly sensitive to sensory input and have narrow interests. Parents often struggle to find appropriate activities, which can make family interactions stressful. With CozySteps, we aimed to reduce decision fatigue for parents and make daily life more enjoyable for everyone.    🤖 What We Built  We created a mobile app prototype called CozySteps, with an activity recommendation engine powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It analyzes each child’s profile and activity metadata to provide personalized suggestions.  Key features:          🧒 Child Profile Management Parents can record the child’s age, interests, and sensory sensitivities.           🎯 LLM-powered Activity Recommendations A curated activity database combined with an LLM inference layer suggests 3 tailored activities at a time.           💬 Parent Feedback Loop After completing an activity, parents can give simple feedback. The LLM interprets feedback to refine future recommendations.           📅 Schedule &amp; Reminders Parents can add activities to a calendar and receive reminders to build predictable daily routines.      The UI is calm and icon-based to minimize sensory overload and support neurodiverse users.    📸 A Glimpse of the App      🛠 Tech Stack     Frontend: React + styled-components   AI logic: LLM-based reasoning + rule-based activity metadata   Data: local JSON storage   Prototyping: Figma   We chose a lightweight front-end + local data + LLM API inference architecture to stay focused on user experience and AI logic during the hackathon timeframe.    Participating in Impact Hack 2025 was an inspiring experience — we’re happy we could build something warm and helpful for families with autistic children 🌈 "
