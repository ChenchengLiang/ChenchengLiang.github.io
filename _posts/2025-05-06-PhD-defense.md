## Short Introduction

Symbolic solvers rely on hand‑crafted heuristics that often fail to generalize. This thesis replaces or augments them with learned guidance: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on graph representations of Constrained Horn Clauses and word equations. Integrated into a CHC solver and a word‑equation solver, the models guide clause and branch selection and deliver consistent speedups, with practical techniques (caching, hybrid heuristics, selective queries) to control overhead. The results point to scalable, data‑driven heuristics for formal methods and motivate extensions to models, datasets, and the word‑equation pipeline.
