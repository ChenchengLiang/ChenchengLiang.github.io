# Assisting Mat Collishawâ€™s *Insilico* in Uppsala

I had the chance to contribute to **Mat Collishawâ€™s touring exhibition** at the [Uppsala Art Museum](https://konstmuseum.uppsala.se/en/).
[Mat Collishaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_Collishaw) is a contemporary British artist, known for using photography, film, and installation to explore themes of beauty, cruelty, and the darker sides of human nature.

The work, [*Insilico*](https://matcollishaw.com/works/insilico/), features a **life-sized animatronic Stag** that slips, slides, and falls depending on the intensity of online abuse directed at individuals on Twitter.


The concept builds on **sentiment and hate speech analysis**. Bespoke software continuously trawls Twitter to detect who is most abused on the platform. Incoming tweets are rated according to their abusive intensity, and this data drives the Stagâ€™s movements. A monitor placed behind the installation displays both the live Twitter feed and the code processing the results.

My role was to **integrate AI-based sentiment analysis** into this system. By analyzing the language in real-time tweets, the model translated the fluctuations of online abuse into physical gestures of the animatronic Stag â€” a bridge between digital hostility and embodied vulnerability.
